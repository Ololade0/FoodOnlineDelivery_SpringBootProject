Food Delivery API
This is an API for a food delivery service, created using Node.js and Express.js. It provides the necessary endpoints for browsing restaurants, viewing menus, placing orders, and handling order fulfillment.

Features
The API provides the following features:

Browsing restaurants
Viewing restaurant menus
Placing orders
Handling order fulfillment
Authentication and authorization for sensitive endpoints
Validation and error handling for incoming requests
Endpoints
Browsing Restaurants
GET /restaurants - Returns a list of all restaurants.
Viewing Menus
GET /restaurants/:id/menu - Returns the menu for a specific restaurant.
Placing Orders
POST /orders - Places a new order.
Handling Order Fulfillment
PUT /orders/:id/fulfill - Marks an order as fulfilled.
Authentication and Authorization
The following endpoints require authentication and/or authorization:

POST /restaurants - Creates a new restaurant (requires authentication).
PUT /restaurants/:id - Updates a restaurant (requires authentication and authorization).
DELETE /restaurants/:id - Deletes a restaurant (requires authentication and authorization).
POST /menu - Creates a new menu (requires authentication and authorization).
PUT /menu/:id - Updates a menu (requires authentication and authorization).
DELETE /menu/:id - Deletes a menu (requires authentication and authorization).
Validation and Error Handling
The API validates incoming requests and returns appropriate error messages when necessary. The following error messages may be returned:

400 Bad Request - The request was invalid or malformed.
401 Unauthorized - The request requires authentication but no valid credentials were provided.
403 Forbidden - The request was valid but the user is not authorized to access the requested resource.
404 Not Found - The requested resource could not be found.
500 Internal Server Error - An error occurred on the server.
Authentication and Authorization
To access sensitive endpoints, users must authenticate using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). To obtain a JWT, users must first create an account by sending a POST request to the /users endpoint with their email and password. The API will then return a JWT, which the user can use to authenticate subsequent requests.

Usage
To test the API, follow these <strong>steps</strong>:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using npm install.
Start the server using npm start.
Use a tool like Postman to send requests to the API endpoints.
Authenticate using a JWT obtained from the /users endpoint.
Conclusion
That's it! You now have a basic understanding of the Food Delivery API and how to use it. Feel free to make any changes or improvements to the API and contribute to the project.
